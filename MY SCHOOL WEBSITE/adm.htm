A motto is the guiding principle, it is a constant slogan reminding us of our cherished goal and we are reminded through the motto to serve and to serve even before our own self. Service is the religion of our life and to serve before self is the method of or worship, while doing service to others we have to rise above our own self. That is to say, we have to become selfless. We have first to care for others more and then look towards our own interest. We have always to feel and understand the words of the Bible; “Thy need is greater than mine”, Once we understand the secret meaning of this motto we shall make this earth a better and brighter home for the mankind, we shall then create through our glorious motto a new world of universal love and universal brotherhood.
