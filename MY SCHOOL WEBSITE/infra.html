<h2>BEST PRACTICES</h2>
<ul>
<li>As stewards in the preservation of our culture and promotion of education, our aim is to provide maximum exposure to our students. Our incessant efforts are to base all learning experiences on the Four Pillars of Learning i.e. learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live together and maximise experiential learning so that the learning outcome is achieved.</li>
<li>An integrated approach is utilised in order to bring relevance to what is taught. Our teachers provide learning experiences which ensure understanding, application and critical thinking. Our activities also involved utilisation of maximum number of senses in keeping with Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. Due respect is also given to the individualistic learning styles. The school also promotes inclusive practices.</li>
<li>Our primary wing believes in experiential learning and hence teaching occurs primarily through activities. These activities develop cognitive, social and psychomotor skills. To bring out the hidden talents in every child, various competitions which develop language skills, reasoning and decision making are held.</li></ul><br><br><br>

A motto is the guiding principle, it is a constant slogan reminding us of our cherished goal and we are reminded through the motto to serve and to serve even before our own self. Service is the religion of our life and to serve before self is the method of or worship, while doing service to others we have to rise above our own self. That is to say, we have to become selfless. We have first to care for others more and then look towards our own interest. We have always to feel and understand the words of the Bible; “Thy need is greater than mine”, Once we understand the secret meaning of this motto we shall make this earth a better and brighter home for the mankind, we shall then create through our glorious motto a new world of universal love and universal brotherhood.
